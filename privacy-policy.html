        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how our Screen Recorder application ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>Our App is designed with privacy in mind. We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information to use the core screen recording features.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>When you use the App, we may automatically collect certain information, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (model, operating system version)</li>
            <li>App usage statistics (features used, crash reports)</li>
            <li>Technical data necessary for app functionality</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>1.3 Recorded Content</h3>
        <p>All screen recordings and screenshots created by the App are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to, collect, or transmit your recorded content to our servers or any third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Bright SDK Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: August 8, 2023</p>

        <div class="bright-data-section">
            <p><strong>In return for some of the premium features of 'Screen Recorder App', you may choose to be a peer on the Bright Data network. By doing so you agree to have read and accepted the Terms of Service of the Bright SDK EULA: <a href="https://bright-sdk.com/eula" target="_blank">https://bright-sdk.com/eula</a> and Bright Data's Privacy Policy <a href="https://brightdata.com/legal/sdk-privacy" target="_blank">https://brightdata.com/legal/sdk-privacy</a>. You may opt out of the Bright Data network by going to the app Settings and turning off the "Web Indexing" toggle.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Bright SDK privacy in simple terms</h3>

        <p>Let's be very clear: We don't know any personal information about you, who you are, or what you do online.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We don't know your name, your email, what web pages you visit, or what apps you use.</li>
            <li>We don't read identifiers that already exist on your device (for example: Apple's IDFA)</li>
            <li>We don't leave any cookies or other identifiers on your device.</li>
            <li>We don't know or track what you do on a specific app, or across several apps.</li>
            <li>Since we don't have any data about you, we of course have nothing to share with 3rd parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In other words, to us all Bright SDK users are anonymous and indistinguishable. We just don't need to know any of your personal information, and we don't track you in any way.</p>

        <p>There is one thing we know, and that is your IP address. We respect all applicable data privacy regulations when it comes to it.</p>

        <p>BTW, you know who else knows your IP address? Any website you visit, and any app you use – they all know your IP address too. Don't believe it? Try googling "what is my IP address" for example, or check your Internet speed on www.speedtest.net or check your location on iplocation.net. Can you see your IP address come up on screen?</p>

        <p>Even though we know your IP, we do not use it for Bright Data's ongoing business operations. In fact, the reason we collect it is to comply with GDPR (e.g. record the fact you gave your consent) and to comply with other legal requirements.</p>

        <p>To summarize – search engines, social networks and advertising networks all need some sort of information about you in order to decide which ads to display to you. Bright SDK is totally different. It does not display ads, does not collect any of your personal information, and does not track you in any way.</p>

        <p>We hope this helps clarify what we know about you. Now, feel free to read the full policy:</p>

        <h3>Our official privacy policy</h3>

        <p>Bright Data Ltd.("Bright Data ", "we," or "us") is the owner of the website brightdata.com ("the Site"), the Bright Data software ("the Software"), the Bright SDK ("the SDK") and the Bright Data services (as detailed below), any accompanying services, features, content, and applications offered by us (collectively referred herein as "the Services").

        </ul>

        <h3>Legal basis for processing</h3>

        <p>Processing of Personal Information is necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations towards you and providing you with our services, to protect our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations.</p>

        <h3>How we use the information we collect</h3>

            <li>To perform analysis and research to improve the Service;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information we share</h3>

        <p>We do not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>We may transfer or disclose Personal Information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, subcontractors, or such other trusted third party service providers or partners, who are located in different jurisdictions across the world, for the purpose of: (a) storing or processing such information on our behalf (e.g. on cloud computing services) or to assist us with our business operations, to authenticate your access and to provide and improve our Service; (b) performing research, technical diagnostics, analytics or statistical purposes.</p>

        <p>The above shall be deemed as the categories of Personal Information we have disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months for the purpose of the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 et seq. ("CCPA").</p>

        <p>We may also share your Personal Information and other information in special cases if we have good reason to believe that it is necessary to: (1) comply with law, regulation, subpoena or court order; (2) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security, violation of our policies or technical issues; (3) enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy or any other agreements between you and us, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (4) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of us, its partners, its affiliates, users, or the public.</p>

        <p>We have not sold (as this term is defined under the CCPA) Your Personal Information in the preceding 12 months.</p>

        <h3>Security and Confidentiality</h3>

        <p>We use industry-standard security tools and measures, as well as internal procedures and strict guidelines to prevent information misuse and data leakage. Our employees and contractors access the information on a need-to-know basis and subject to confidentiality obligations.</p>

        <p>We use measures and procedures that substantially reduce the risks of data misuse, but we cannot guarantee that our systems will be absolutely safe. If you become aware of any potential data breach or security vulnerability, you are requested to contact us immediately. We will use all measures to investigate the incident, including preventive measures, as required.</p>

        <p>Since we operate globally, it may be required to transfer your Personal Information to other countries worldwide. In these instances, we will take steps to ensure that a similar level of protection is given to your Personal Information through adequate legal mechanisms, in accordance with the GDPR.</p>

        <h3>Your Choices and Retention</h3>

        <p>We value your privacy and your control of personal information. You may therefore notify us that you wish to review your Personal Information or delete it.
