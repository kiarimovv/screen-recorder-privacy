        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how our Screen Recorder application ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>Our App is designed with privacy in mind. We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information to use the core screen recording features.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>When you use the App, we may automatically collect certain information, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (model, operating system version)</li>
            <li>App usage statistics (features used, crash reports)</li>
            <li>Technical data necessary for app functionality</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>1.3 Recorded Content</h3>
        <p>All screen recordings and screenshots created by the App are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to, collect, or transmit your recorded content to our servers or any third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Bright Data SDK Integration</h2>

        <div class="bright-data-section">
            <h3>2.1 Required Notice</h3>
            <p><strong>In return for some of the premium features of 'Screen Recorder App', you may choose to be a peer on the Bright Data network. By doing so you agree to have read and accepted the Terms of Service of the Bright SDK EULA: <a href="https://bright-sdk.com/eula" target="_blank">https://bright-sdk.com/eula</a> and Bright Data's Privacy Policy <a href="https://brightdata.com/legal/sdk-privacy" target="_blank">https://brightdata.com/legal/sdk-privacy</a>.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>You may opt out of the Bright Data network by going to the app Settings and turning off the "Web Indexing" toggle.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>2.2 Bright SDK Privacy in Simple Terms</h3>
        <p>Let's be very clear: <strong>Bright Data doesn't know any personal information about you, who you are, or what you do online.</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Bright Data doesn't know your name, your email, what web pages you visit, or what apps you use</li>
            <li>Bright Data doesn't read identifiers that already exist on your device (for example: Apple's IDFA)</li>
            <li>Bright Data doesn't leave any cookies or other identifiers on your device</li>
            <li>Bright Data doesn't know or track what you do on a specific app, or across several apps</li>
            <li>Since Bright Data doesn't have any data about you, they have nothing to share with 3rd parties</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In other words, to Bright Data all SDK users are anonymous and indistinguishable. They just don't need to know any of your personal information, and they don't track you in any way.</p>

        <p><strong>There is one thing Bright Data knows, and that is your IP address.</strong> They respect all applicable data privacy regulations when it comes to it.</p>

        <p>Even though Bright Data knows your IP, they do not use it for ongoing business operations. In fact, the reason they collect it is to comply with GDPR (e.g. record the fact you gave your consent) and to comply with other legal requirements.</p>

        <h3>2.3 What is Bright Data SDK?</h3>
        <p>Bright Data provides proxy services and data collector products and services. Bright Data gives its customers the ability to route traffic through its peers' available resources. Bright Data treats certain devices of peers as nodes in the Bright Data network used to operate the Services. <strong>Peers agree to share their available resources and become part of the Bright Data network in return for free features, ads free app, etc.</strong></p>

        <h3>2.4 What Information Does Bright Data Collect?</h3>
        <p>Bright Data collects the following types of data when you use the SDK:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> This information cannot be used to identify you. Such Non-Personal Information includes aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, such as your approximate geo-location, hardware specifications, OS and SDK version, browser type and version, the date of the Software installation, your URL requests, and respective time stamps.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> The only Personal Information Bright Data may collect and retain is your IP address, which is necessary in order to provide the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.5 How Bright Data Uses the Information</h3>
        <p>Bright Data may use the information for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide their Services, including audits and calculations of fees</li>
            <li>To detect and prevent illegal activity, activity that violates their terms of use, or any other type of activity that may jeopardize or negatively affect the integrity of the Service</li>
            <li>To perform analysis and research to improve the Service</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.6 Information Bright Data Shares</h3>
        <p>Bright Data does not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with third parties except as described in their Privacy Policy. They may transfer or disclose Personal Information to their subsidiaries, affiliated companies, subcontractors, or such other trusted third party service providers or partners for the purpose of storing or processing such information on their behalf.</p>

            <li>Contact Bright Data at <a href="mailto:privacy@bright-sdk.com">privacy@bright-sdk.com</a></li>

        <p><strong>For California residents:</strong> You have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) including the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your rights.</p>
